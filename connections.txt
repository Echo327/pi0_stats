Exactly where I have them connected (for now, just a suggestion, but change at your own risks)

GND : 20 (Ground)
VCC : 17 (3v3 Power)
D0  : 23 - BCM 11 (SCLK)
D1  : 19 - BCM 10 (MOSI)
RES : 18 - BCM 24 [as written in code]
DC  : 16 - BCM 23 [as written in code]
CS  : 24 - BCM 8 (CE0) [SPI Chip Select]

I use this interactive website for easy GPIO pinout guide:
https://pinout.xyz/

I am also including the official schematics file (for the brave and initiated) for the Raspberry Pi Zero v1.3 (which I am using).

As far as I know, the Pi Zero v1.3 and the regular Pi have the same GPIO pinout.
